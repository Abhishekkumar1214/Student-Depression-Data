Student_Depression_Analysis

ðŸ§  A comprehensive data analysis project focused on understanding depression trends among students using Python. Leveraged survey data to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The project investigates patterns in mental health indicators such as stress levels, sleep patterns, academic pressure, and social connectivity. Visualized key relationships and correlations between different factors affecting student well-being. Plotted insightful graphs to identify possible red flags and trends in student mental health.
Developed as part of the INT375: Data Science Toolbox course to build hands-on experience in handling real-world datasets and deriving meaningful insights through Python-based analysis.
